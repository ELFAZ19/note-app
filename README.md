# Theme Toggle with Persistence

This project demonstrates how to implement a light/dark theme toggle that persists across page reloads using JavaScript, CSS, and `localStorage`. The theme toggle updates the page's appearance based on the user's preference and remembers it even after refreshing the page.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How it Works

1. **Initial Load:** On page load, the script checks if there‚Äôs a saved theme in `localStorage`. If "dark" is saved, the dark theme is applied automatically.
   
2. **Theme Toggle:** When the user clicks the toggle button, the theme switches between light and dark mode. The theme is saved to `localStorage` for persistence.

3. **Persistence:** The selected theme remains active even after the page reloads.

2. Open `index.html` in a browser to see the theme toggle in action.
