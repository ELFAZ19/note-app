# 📒Note App
--
This is a simple Note App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to create, edit, and delete notes, with the added feature of theme switching (light/dark mode) and persistence across page reloads using `localStorage`. It’s a great project for understanding the basics of web development, local storage, and theme management.

2. **Edit Notes:** Click on a note to edit its content. The edited note is saved automatically.
3. **Delete Notes:** Delete any note by clicking the delete button next to it.
4. **Search Notes:** Use the search bar to filter and find specific notes based on their content.
5. **Theme Toggle:** Use the light/dark mode toggle to switch between themes. The selected theme is saved and persists across page reloads.
6. **Persistence:** Both notes and the selected theme are saved in `localStorage`, so they remain even after refreshing the page.
